# Wildfire-Spread-Rate-Algorithm-Analysis


This program creates a forest of given dimenstions and density, and can simulate if a fire will spread to the bottom.
It also as functions that simulate many forest fires to find the probability of fire spreading for density, and also 
what density gets a specific probability of fire spreading
